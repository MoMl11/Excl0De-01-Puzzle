Excl0De 01 Puzzle

Hello everyone,

Get ready to dive into the dark and mysterious world of my new online puzzle, inspired by the enigmatic Cicada 3310. This puzzle is not for the faint of heart – it will test your mind to its limits and become increasingly unsettling with each stage.

Some challenges will require you to search not only online but also in the real world. You may find clues in unexpected places, forcing you to sharpen your eye for detail and question the ordinary. Each puzzle holds secrets waiting to be uncovered, and only a select few will be able to solve them.

While the puzzle is still a work in progress, there are already several stages available for those daring enough to try. With hidden texts in cryptic photos and intricate decryption techniques, you'll need to stay alert and think critically.

Soon, new, even more chilling stages will be released, pushing your problem-solving skills to the ultimate test. This is a race against time and a challenge for your intellect.

Good luck—you'll need it!
